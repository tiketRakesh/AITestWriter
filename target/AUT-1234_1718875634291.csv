"**Positive Test Cases:**"
""
"1. **Get All Employees with Default Pagination:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request to the API URL without specifying any query parameters."
"- Expected Result: The response should return the first page of employees with a default page size."
"2. **Get Specific Page and Size:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request with specific `page` and `per_page` query parameters."
"- Expected Result: The response should return the specified page of employees with the specified page size."
"3. **Search Employees by Name:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request with a `search` query parameter containing a valid employee name."
"- Expected Result: The response should return a list of employees whose names match the search term."
"4. **Get Employee by ID:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request to the API URL with an employee's `id` appended to the path."
"- Expected Result: The response should return the employee object with the specified ID."
"**Negative Test Cases:**"
"1. **Empty Page Request:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request with an invalid or empty `page` query parameter."
"- Expected Result: The response should return an error indicating invalid pagination parameters."
"2. **Invalid Size Request:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request with an invalid or negative `per_page` query parameter."
"3. **Search with Invalid Term:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request with a `search` query parameter containing an invalid or non-existent employee name."
"- Expected Result: The response should return an empty list or an error indicating no matching results."
"4. **Access with Invalid Token:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request with an invalid OAuth 2.0 access token."
"- Expected Result: The response should return a ""401 Unauthorized"" status code."
"5. **Forbidden Access:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a GET request with an access token that does not have the necessary permissions to access the API."
"- Expected Result: The response should return a ""403 Forbidden"" status code."
"**Non-Functional Test Cases:**"
""
"1. **Performance Test:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send multiple concurrent requests to the API and measure the response time and throughput."
"- Expected Result: The API should handle the load without significant performance degradation."
"2. **Security Test:**"
"- Test Scenario: Attempt to access the API using various attack techniques, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and brute force attacks."
"- Expected Result: The API should be resistant to these attacks and protect sensitive data."
"3. **Reliability Test:**"
"- Test Scenario: Simulate network failures, server outages, and other disruptions to test the API's ability to recover and maintain uptime."
"- Expected Result: The API should be highly available and resilient to these disruptions."
"4. **Scalability Test:**"
"- Test Scenario: Gradually increase the load on the API and monitor its performance."
"- Expected Result: The API should scale gracefully and maintain acceptable performance even under heavy load."
"5. **Stress Test:**"
"- Test Scenario: Subject the API to extreme load conditions beyond its expected capacity."
"- Expected Result: The API should handle the stress without crashing or losing data."
"6. **Documentation Test:**"
"- Test Scenario: Review the API documentation and ensure that it is clear, accurate, and up-to-date."
"- Expected Result: The documentation should provide comprehensive guidance on how to use the API."
"7. **User Interface Test (if applicable):**"
"- Test Scenario: Test the user interface of the API (e.g., web portal or command-line tool) for usability, accessibility, and consistency."
"- Expected Result: The user interface should be intuitive, easy to use, and meet accessibility standards."
"**Non-Functional Test Cases for GetEmployees API:**"
""
"**Performance Test Cases:**"
"1. **High Volume Request Load:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a large number of concurrent GET requests to the API to simulate high traffic."
"- Expected Result: The API should respond to requests within acceptable response times and maintain stability."
"2. **Response Time under Load:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send a series of GET requests while monitoring the response times."
"- Expected Result: The API should maintain consistent response times even under load."
"**Security Test Cases:**"
"1. **Input Validation:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send GET requests with invalid or malformed query parameters."
"- Expected Result: The API should reject invalid requests and return appropriate error messages."
"2. **Authentication and Authorization:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send GET requests with invalid or expired OAuth 2.0 access tokens."
"- Expected Result: The API should reject unauthorized requests and return appropriate error messages."
"**Reliability Test Cases:**"
"1. **API Uptime:**"
"- Test Scenario: Monitor the API availability over a period of time."
"- Expected Result: The API should be available for use during the specified uptime period."
"2. **Error Handling:**"
"- Test Scenario: Send GET requests that trigger different types of errors (e.g., invalid pagination parameters, non-existent employee)."
"- Expected Result: The API should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages."
"**Regression Test Cases:**"
"1. **Regression Testing after Code Changes:**"
"- Test Scenario: Re-run existing test cases after making changes to the API codebase."
"- Expected Result: The API should continue to function as expected after code changes."
