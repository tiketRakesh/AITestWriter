"Test cases"
"**Functional Tests:**"
""
"* **Valid Login:**"
"- Enter a valid username, password, and captcha."
"- Verify that the user is successfully logged in."
"* **Invalid Username:**"
"- Enter an invalid username."
"- Verify that an error message is displayed and the user is not logged in."
"* **Invalid Password:**"
"- Enter a valid username and an invalid password."
"* **Invalid Captcha:**"
"- Enter a valid username and password but an invalid captcha."
"* **Empty Fields:**"
"- Leave the username, password, or captcha field empty."
"* **Special Characters:**"
"- Enter username, password, or captcha containing special characters."
"- Verify that the user is still able to log in."
"**Security Tests:**"
"* **SQL Injection:**"
"- Attempt to inject SQL code into the login fields."
"- Verify that the system is not vulnerable to SQL injections."
"* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**"
"- Attempt to inject malicious JavaScript code into the login fields."
"- Verify that the system is not vulnerable to XSS attacks."
"* **Brute Force Attack:**"
"- Use a tool to send multiple login attempts with different passwords."
"- Verify that the system implements measures to prevent brute force attacks."
"**Performance Tests:**"
"* **Load Testing:**"
"- Simulate a large number of concurrent login requests."
"- Verify that the system can handle the load without significant performance degradation."
"* **Stress Testing:**"
"- Simulate extreme load conditions with additional system stress."
"- Verify that the system remains stable and accessible."
"**Other Tests:**"
"* **Localization:**"
"- Test the login feature in different languages to ensure proper localization."
"* **Accessibility:**"
"- Verify that the login feature is accessible to users with disabilities."
"* **Regression Testing:**"
"- Re-run existing test cases after software updates or bug fixes to ensure that previous functionality is not affected."
"**Non-Functional Test Cases for Login API:**"
""
"**Performance Tests:**"
"* **Response Time:**"
"- Measure the response time of the login API under different load conditions."
"- Verify that the response time meets the specified performance requirements."
"* **Throughput:**"
"- Determine the maximum number of login requests that the API can handle per second."
"- Verify that the API can handle the expected load without performance degradation."
"**Reliability Tests:**"
"* **Availability:**"
"- Simulate outages and network disruptions to test the availability of the login API."
"- Verify that the API remains accessible and functional during these events."
"* **Fault Tolerance:**"
"- Introduce faults into the system, such as database connectivity issues or server failures."
"- Verify that the API can handle these faults gracefully and recover quickly."
"**Security Tests:**"
"* **Authentication:**"
"- Verify that the API implements strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access."
"- Test the API's ability to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate login attempts."
"* **Authorization:**"
"- Verify that the API enforces proper authorization controls to restrict access to protected resources."
"- Test the API's ability to grant and revoke access based on user roles and permissions."
"**Usability Tests:**"
"* **User Interface:**"
"- Evaluate the user interface of the login API for ease of use and clarity."
"- Verify that users can easily enter their credentials and submit the login request."
"* **Error Handling:**"
"- Verify that the API provides clear and helpful error messages in case of login failures."
"- Test the API's ability to handle different types of errors gracefully."
"**Other Non-Functional Tests:**"
"* **Scalability:**"
"- Test the API's ability to scale to support a growing number of users and login requests."
"- Verify that the API can maintain performance and reliability under increasing load."
"* **Maintainability:**"
"- Evaluate the codebase of the login API for maintainability and extensibility."
"- Verify that the API is well-documented and easy to modify or enhance."
